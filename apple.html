<h2>Apple</h2>
<p>Apple, common name for certain related trees of the rose family, and for the fruit of the tree. The color of the fruit varies from green to a deep, blackish red. The fruit's shape can also differ greatly, and its size ranges from hardly larger than a cherry to as big as a medium-sized grapefruit. Apple trees grow mainly in the temperate areas of the world. Some apple blossoms are white, but most have stripes or tints of rose, and a few bright red. Apple wood is hard, durable, and very fine-grained.</p>

<p>Apples are eaten in the fresh state, served as the chief ingredient of such desserts as baked apples, apple pie, and apple strudel; and processed into dried apples, canned sauce, slices, jelly, juice, cider, vinegar, and brandy.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<blockquote><p align="justify">The apple tree orginated probably in the area between the Caspian and the Black seas, and apples were a favorite fruit of the ancient Greeks and Romans. The apple was introduced to America by early settlers. Seeds were carried westward by missionaries, traders, and Native Americans. One man, John Appleseed, was responsible for extensive plantings of apple trees in the midwestern United States.</p></blockquote>
